have selected the right model of printer in the Settings menu. You can use the USB connector kit now 
to plug an external SD card into your device, and the generated file will be saved into the root

sure that the print is fine. The app developers are not responsible for any damage that may occur to 
your printer (or other device) as a result of using this app.</string>
